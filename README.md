## Debugging

After starting the app with `npm run dev:debug`, you've two options:

1. For in-editor debug with VSCode, configuration already included in `.vscode/launch.json`. It will attach the debbuger to the running process.
2. You can look at `chrome://inspect` to open a debugger panel using Google Chrome DevTools.

## NTH (Nice to haves)

- Tumble Sender Addresses to limit spam
- Add Provider for Whatsapp
- Add Provider for Twitter Alerts to Public Servants
- Multiple Messaging Formats
- More recipients apart from Senators to entities [Governors, President,State Judiciary]
- Possibly open this API up so that users can publish their own messages through the queue
- Move the Public Servants Entity to some `Airtable` so that contact information can be crowd sourced
